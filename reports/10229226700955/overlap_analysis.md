G2 fetched: 56 groups, price range $3,450 – $25,300 total
G4 fetched: 29 groups → 87 derived adjacent pairs

| Bucket     | Count | % of derived | Notes                          |
|------------|-------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| DUPLICATE  |     0 |        0.0% | Already in G2 response         |
| IN_RANGE   |    84 |       96.6% | May exist in G2, not top-100   |
| NEW        |     3 |        3.4% | Genuinely new options          |

Overlap rate: 0.0% (DUPLICATE / total)
Verdict: **INVESTIGATE** — Many IN_RANGE pairs; consider paginated G2 fetch before adding.
